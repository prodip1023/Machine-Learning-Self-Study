    "- OPTICS (Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure) is a density-based clustering algorithm, similar to DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise), but it can extract clusters of varying densities and shapes. It is useful for identifying clusters of different densities in large, high-dimensional datasets.\n",
    "- The main idea behind OPTICS is to extract the clustering structure of a dataset by identifying the density-connected points. The algorithm builds a density-based representation of the data by creating an ordered list of points called the reachability plot. Each point in the list is associated with a reachability distance, which is a measure of how easy it is to reach that point from other points in the dataset. Points with similar reachability distances are likely to be in the same cluster."
